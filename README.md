WARNING: Method interfaces may change in the future based on feedback.

Go (golang) implementation of the [Wargaming.net Public API](https://developers.wargaming.net/documentation/guide/getting-started/). Providing structs and functions.

This api client is fully generated automatically based on the provided documentation of Wargaming.
This documentation is often inaccurate, especially the return types (object, list, map), so manual fixes afterwards are required. If something was not corrected, please open an issue.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/IceflowRE/go-wargaming/pkg/wargaming"
)

func main() {
	// create client
	client := wargaming.NewClient("a7f838650dcb008552966db063eeeb35")
	// get account list
	res, err := client.WotAccountList(wargaming.RealmEu, "Yzne", []string{}, "", 0, "")
	// print out
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err.Error())
	} else {
		for _, value := range res {
			fmt.Println(value)
		}
	}
}
```

With custom http client.

client := wargaming.NewClient("d5dcedcbea865ea892202ba7361e626c").
    WithHttpClient(&http.Client{
        Timeout: 10 * time.Second,
    })
```
